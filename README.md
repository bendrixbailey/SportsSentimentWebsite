# Welcome
    This repo hosts the website code needed to run the front end of our 
    sports sentiment predictor project. 

# Features
    Specify two teams, the respective cities of each teams, the date of the game, and the
    type of sport the teams are both playing. (We dont have much input checking, so
    please make sure its correct otherwise the output will be bad). e.g if you enter in the
    wrong city, the search results will be wonky, so please double check!

    Two cards at the bottom that show the general sentiment, and the confidence
    of the sentiment.


# Request data
    The format of the incoming data for comprehend results MUST be in the following format
            ```json

                   "t2Confidence" : "",

# Parent Project
    The main project this is part of is linked here https://github.com/RIT-cloud-computing/term-project-team-team-3

    The website had to be hosted in a separate public repo, because AWS Amplify requires either a public repo or access to a private repo, and since the parent repo is private, it was unable to get access to the code.
